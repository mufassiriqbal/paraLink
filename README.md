Individuals with severe paralysis, such as those affected by spinal cord injuries, ALS, or stroke, often lose their ability to communicate effectively and perform basic daily activities independently. Traditional assistive technologies are either too costly, limited in functionality, or difficult to operate without external assistance.
The absence of an affordable, user-friendly, and multifunctional system restricts their independence, leaving them dependent on caregivers for both communication of essential needs (e.g., hunger, pain, emotions) and control over their living environment (e.g., lights, fans). This creates a significant barrier to their quality of life, mental well-being, and sense of autonomy.
There is a critical need for an integrated, accessible solution that enables paralyzed individuals to both communicate and control their surroundings effortlessly through natural, non-invasive methods like eye-tracking or EOG signals.
